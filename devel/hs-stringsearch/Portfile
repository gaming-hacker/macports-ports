description         Substring search package
long_description \
    This package provides several functions to quickly search for substrings \
    in strict or lazy ByteStrings. It also provides functions for breaking \
    or splitting on substrings and replacing all occurrences of a substring \
    (the first in case of overlaps) with another.
