description		C library that handles C strings in a safe way. 
long_description	Safe Strings is a small C library that handles C strings \
				in a safe way. The functions of this library look at the \
				necessary space for the operations and try to reserve that \
				space (with malloc or realloc). The functions only begin \
				working with their tasks when the memory allocation is \
				successful.
