description         audio codec designed for speech

long_description    Speex is an Open Source/Free Software \
                    patent-free audio compression format \
                    designed for speech. The Speex Project \
                    aims to lower the barrier of entry for \
                    voice applications by providing a free \
                    alternative to expensive proprietary \
                    speech codecs.  Moreover, Speex is \
                    well-adapted to Internet applications \
                    and provides useful features that are \
                    not present in most other codecs.
