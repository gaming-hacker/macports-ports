description         graphical front end to the diff program

long_description    tkdiff is a graphical front end to the diff program. It \
                    provides a side-by-side view of the differences between \
                    two files, along with several innovative features such as \
                    diff bookmarks and a graphical map of differences for \
                    quick navigation.
