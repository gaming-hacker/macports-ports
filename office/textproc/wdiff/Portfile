description         Display word differences between text files

long_description    wdiff compares two files, finding which words have been \
                    deleted or added to old_file to get new_file. A word is \
                    anything between whitespace. The output is collected and \
                    used to produce an annotated copy of new_file on standard \
                    output. Suitable annotations produce a nice display of \
                    word differences between the original files.
